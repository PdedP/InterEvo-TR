<h2>InterEvo-TR: Interactive Evolutionary Test Generation with Readability Assessment Replication Package </h2>

This repository contains additional material to the paper entitled *"InterEvo-TR: Interactive Evolutionary Test Generation with Readability Assessment"*, currently under revision. Namely:

- **InterEvo-TR**: the implementation of our interactive approach.
- **Working dataset**: the files used for our empirical study:
	- The running example used in the first part of the experiment.
	- The survey performed by the participants.
	- The class under test and its test runner with the configuration of interaction-related parameters.
	- The automatically-generated test suites for the comparison of the results.
- **Participant results**: the data collected from each participant's execution.
- **Example of interaction**: step-by-step example of the interactions of one participant.
- **Analysis**: the set of analyses performed to answer the research questions.
	- *RQ1*: the data for each class under test divided by group (g0, g1-9 and g10+) and statistical tests.
	- *RQ2-RQ4*: answers to the survey and combined data from the executions, extended technical report, scripts used and plots obtained.
